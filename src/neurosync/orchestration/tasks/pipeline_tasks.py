"""
Pipeline orchestration tasks for NeuroSync ETL workflows.

This module defines task implementations for orchestrating the complete
NeuroSync ETL pipeline using workflow orchestration frameworks like
Airflow, Prefect, or Temporal. It provides standardized task definitions
for data ingestion, processing, embedding, and indexing operations.

Key Features:
    - Modular task definitions for each pipeline stage
    - Dependency management and task sequencing
    - Error handling and retry mechanisms
    - Progress monitoring and status reporting
    - Resource allocation and scaling capabilities
    - Configurable execution strategies
    - Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

Task Categories:
    Ingestion Tasks: Data source connection and content extraction
    Processing Tasks: Text cleaning, chunking, and quality assessment
    Embedding Tasks: Vector generation and similarity computation
    Storage Tasks: Vector database indexing and metadata storage
    Validation Tasks: Quality checks and pipeline validation
    Cleanup Tasks: Resource cleanup and temporary data removal

Orchestration Features:
    - Dynamic task generation based on data sources
    - Parallel execution for independent operations
    - Conditional task execution based on data characteristics
    - Retry strategies with exponential backoff
    - Resource quotas and throttling for system protection
    - Pipeline checkpointing and resume capabilities

Example Pipeline:
    ingest_data >> preprocess_content >> generate_embeddings >> store_vectors
